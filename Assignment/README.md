Instructions
The player is first given a menu screen and given the choice of one or two
player modes. From then on the game is controlled through various states. In one
player mode the blocks that are caught are randomly generated and the game has a
win condition when the stack reaches the top of the screen and a lose condition
when the stack reaches the bottom of the screen. Two player mode operates in the
same manner however one player selects where the block is placed.
